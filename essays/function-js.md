## JavaScript !== Java

For a while, prior to taking ICS classes, I thought Java and JavaScript was the same language, after all, they do share the same name. When I used to do research problems I had in the Introduction to ICS courses which used Java, I would occasionally come across solutions that looked completely foreign to me, which is where I learned that JavScript was a different language. With a new language also means re-learning syntax and rules to make sure the code is written correctly.

<blockquote>
Q: How do comfort a JavaScript bug? A: You console it.

</blockquote>

And this is what I did to help solve my problems. With learning a new language and the added stress of being timed, I may have overlooked a line of code that was important in the success of the code. One example was when I wrote a while loop withh the variable in the conditional acting as a stopping point once it got too high. The problem was that every time I ran it, it would spit out errors at me and I had no idea why. To see where my code was went wrong I printed things to the console to see where I was messing up, and lo and behold, found that I was in an infinite loop since I did not increment my variables to exit the loop.

But I feel like thats how learning a new programming language goes. You learn the syntax, but the thought process of solving a programing problem stays the same. The only difference is in the way it is written.

Personally, I like it. The first language that I learned was the basics of Python. When I first did my JavScript lessons, it reminded me alot of that, just beacuse everything felt easier to learn. It seems like an easy language to learn, and seems to be much simpler than Java or C. What I am curious about however is if they are all capable of the same things. So far, we only learned the basics and do not know what else JavaScript has to offer us in terms of software engineering. 


## Workout of the Day a.k.a. Panic!

Which is what I tend ot do when I get thrown into unfammiliar situations. I was never given a situation where I was supposed to code on the spot without prior knowledge on what it was going to be. Most of the times, I am given a problem before hand and I have time to think on my own to figure out how to translate a solution written in english to an program.

With workouts of the day, it really keeps you on your toes, requiring you to understand the concept inorder to apply it to other problems. Practicing the same Euler Project sections over and over again can start to be more of a memorization process rather than a learning one. But what one has to understand is the concept so that it can be used anywhere else. I felt like the practce WOD's focused alot on for loops, which was what we needed to use in our in class WOD. I also liked that the difficulty of the bWOD was a bit higher, which was great because we were allowed to experience a more difficult problem, making simpler problems easier to solve.

WOD's are great. It gives me more of a push to study and be constantly at pace with the class, and feel like this style of learning is going to definetly help me become a better ICS student.
