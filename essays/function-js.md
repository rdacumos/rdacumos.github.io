## JavaScript !== Java

For a while, prior to taking ICS classes, I thought Java and JavaScript was the same language, after all, they do share the same name. When I used to do research problems I had in the Introduction to ICS courses which used Java, I would occasionally come across solutions that looked completely foreign to me, which is where I learned that JavScript was a different language.
